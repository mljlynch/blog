I've been wanting to build an online blog for a while, but the cost was always too high. In particular, I wanted one that allowed me to write Markdown files or text files and push commits for changes.

One engineering blog I like a lot is [tkdodo's](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/). I decided to look at how his project was built. Through looking at his commit history, I found that he used [a template from Lekoarts](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog). Amazingly, this template had a one click button to deploy to Netlify. So I was able to clone this template, deploy to Netlify and I was off to the races.

Since then it's been pretty easy to modify. I added a comments section through [giscus](https://giscus.app/) and have written a few blogs. It was nice to have something that was pre-built, with clear setup instructions that I could continue to modify. Substack has made it easier to blog as well, but I find the best technical blogs to be off Substack.

I hope people find this helpful. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments below ⬇️
